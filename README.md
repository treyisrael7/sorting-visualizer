# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based sorting visualizer developed with React, JavaScript, and CSS. This tool allows users to visually explore and compare the performance of different sorting algorithms through dynamic and interactive animations.

## Features

- **Algorithm Support**: Includes visualizations for 6 sorting algorithms:

  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

- **Dynamic Animation Speed**: Automatically adjusts animation speed from 2ms to 300ms based on the number of array bars to ensure smooth performance.

- **Interactive Bar Adjustment**: Users can modify the number of array bars (10 to 450) using a responsive scrollbar.

- **Customizable Color Scheme**:

  - Primary Color: `#244855`
  - Comparison Highlight: `#FFB200`
  - Swap Highlight: `#874F41`
  - Final Color: `#4CAF50`

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes with bars adjusting their width according to the number of bars.
